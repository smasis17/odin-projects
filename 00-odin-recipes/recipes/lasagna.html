<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lasagna, a classic Italian dish, is a savory marvel that tantalizes the taste buds with its layers of rich flavors and textures. This culinary masterpiece features wide sheets of pasta interlaced with hearty fillings such as seasoned ground meat, creamy b√©chamel sauce, and tangy tomato sauce, creating a symphony of indulgence.</p>
<p>Each layer is generously sprinkled with a blend of melted cheeses, typically mozzarella, Parmesan, and ricotta, which form a golden crust when baked to perfection. The result is a harmonious fusion of savory, cheesy, and comforting goodness that delights diners with every forkful.</p>
